# SustainEats

SustainEats is an ongoing React.js-based web application designed to facilitate the sharing of surplus food items among users. It provides a platform for individuals to give away ingredients or food that they won't be using due to travel plans, allergies or other reasons, thereby reducing food wastage and promoting sustainability.

## Background
SustainEats originated form a hackthon involving four passionate individuals aiming to address the issue of food wastage. The idea stemmed from our collective concern about the amount of food discarded unnecessarily due to various reasons. While participating in the hackathon, we conceptualized and prototyped the initial version of SustainEats to enable users to share surplus food within their communities.

## Features (that I want to add soon)
- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles
- Listing Food Items: Easy posting of surplus food items with details such as expiration date, quantity, and reason for gicing it away
- Browse and Filter: Seamless browsing and filtering of available food items based on categories (vegetarian, vegan), proximity
- Messaging System (Thinking about whether this is needed): Integrated messaging system allows users to communicate for coordination and inquiries about listed items

## Tech Stack
- React.js: Used for building frontend user interface
// More to add regarding backend
